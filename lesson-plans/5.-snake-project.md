# 5. Snake project

## Lesson objectives

* Students practise/conslidate JS knowledge by making a game
* Students learn to follow a tutorial

## Lesson time to deliever:

1 sessions, 1.5hrs

## Teacher instruction

* Maybe pair students?

## Snake game

Get students to create a snake game by following one of below guides:

* [https://www.studytonight.com/post/snake-game-in-html-and-javascript](https://www.studytonight.com/post/snake-game-in-html-and-javascript)
* [https://www.codeexplained.org/2018/08/create-snake-game-using-javascript.html](https://www.codeexplained.org/2018/08/create-snake-game-using-javascript.html)  - This one has a youtube video explaination

Completed example \([https://codepen.io/arkev/pen/pDdoL?editors=0010](https://codepen.io/arkev/pen/pDdoL?editors=0010)\)

{% hint style="info" %}
They must add some additional features to the game and get everyone to present and ask questions about their code \(so they don't just copy and paste the tutorial!!!\)
{% endhint %}



Instructions

1. Create canvas

```markup
<canvas id="canvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
```

2. Check created correctly. Explain variables. Case is important

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const width = 400;
const height = 400;
// other way of declaring variable is let. will explain later

ctx.fillStyle = "white";
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
ctx.strokeStyle = "black";
ctx.strokeRect(0, 0, width, height);
```

3. Function

```javascript
function draw(){
  // alert("Hello");
  ctx.fillStyle = "white";
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
  ctx.strokeStyle = "black";
  ctx.strokeRect(0, 0, width, height);
}

draw();
```

4. Paint a cell. Demo in Paint what will do

* Resize canvas
* Draw 2d shape. Line type and fill

![Explain Coordinate system and how it matches up to pixels](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

```javascript
 const cw = 10; // cell width
 
 function paintCell(x, y){
		ctx.fillStyle = "blue";
		ctx.fillRect(x*cw, y*cw, cw, cw);
		ctx.strokeStyle = "white";
		ctx.strokeRect(x*cw, y*cw, cw, cw);
	}
	
	
paintCell(3,2);
```

5. Create a snake

Explain for loop and why better. And arrays

```javascript
	let snake;  // let as will change
	
	function createSnake()
	{
		let length = 5; //Length of the snake
		snake_array = []; //Empty array to start with
		for(let i = length-1; i>=0; i--)
		{
			//This will create a horizontal snake starting from the top left
			snake_array.push({x: i, y:0});
		}
	}
	
```
