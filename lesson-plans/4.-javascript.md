## History of Javascript

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

#### JS has a very interesting history so try to get that cross:

* It was invented in weeks. Most languages are invented in months or years
* It was named Javascript to steal from the popularity of Java which was the hottest language at that time. Backfired now as JS is most popular language in the world and Java is gaining the benifits of that...
* The browser wars. Can make it into a cool game
* JS didnt change in 10 years. Can talk about the drama between Mircosoft \(supported by Yahoo on the commitee\) that had its own browser scripting language \(JScript\) vs the other 4 members of the committee. But best thing for JS as people invented tools to fill in its gaps and it was really stable when JScript and Flash it's main competitors were constantly changing. 
* Ajax - Asynchronous programming. Got invented for JS by open source projects. Now used in most other languages
* End with Modern js frameworks which we will cover in the future \(React.js, 

## Teacher instruction

This is a relatively easy day for the teacher: The students will mostly self learn through the udacity course [https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803)

Create a lesson plan from the course materials above and around basic javascript information below

In the lesson explain a bit of javascript then get the students to do exercises from the Udacity course 

Try to cover as much of the Udacity course as possible. It does most of the teaching for you in a very good way. Let students do it by themselves with you helping out and covering bits for the whole class every 30 minutes/hour to make sure they stay on track.

* Go through basics \(see below: Arrays, objects, selection, for loops\) and explain difference between let and var \(prefer let\), and == vs === \(prefer ===\) Then cover functions in javascript
* Cover getting help: Stackoverflow I use this for JS reference [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
* Cover code pen which is an interactive playground see below:
* Datatypes: Cover this sparingly and more through examples. Don't cover bigInt, or the max and min of number \(Never hit those limits myself\)

### Code pen

[https://codepen.io/](https://codepen.io/)  
My favourite html/js playground. Tons of work people have done

### Debugging

Enuse you: **Cover opening the browser debugger by pressing F12. Chrome is recommended browser as it is the easiest for debugging.**

Then execute the js code in the browser console so students get used to it. But also switch to html file + js file so don't forget that.

### JS Basics:

Open browser. Press F12. Now have developer console. Can run js code

```javascript
// Set a variable
var a = "Hello World";  // Strings can be '' or "". Pick one and stick to it for your code
console.log(a); // Note console almost always there (but not always)

// Create an object
var it = { a: 20, b: "Test" }
console.log(it.a)

// semi-colons (;) are optional. Js will automatically fill for you

// this is also a dictionary
console.log(it["a"])

// Arrays
var myArr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

// This is equivalent to a list in C#
console.log(myArr[0]);   // 'a'
myArr.push(10) // Not typed, so can add anything
myArr[2] = "Testing the world";
console.log(myArr);


// Selection
let b = 10
if(a === 2){
  // will discuss == vs === in a sec
  console.log("b is 2");
} else if(b > 0) {
  console.log("b Positive");
} else {
  console.log("b is negative");
}

// For loop
let str = '';
for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
  str = str + i;
}

console.log(str);

// Can do a For each on an array
var array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach(function(x){ console.log(x)});

// new ES2015 way with function shorthand
array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));
```

#### == Vs ===

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/which-equals-operator-vs-should-be-used-in-javascript-comparisons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/which-equals-operator-vs-should-be-used-in-javascript-comparisons)

```javascript
"0" == 0; // True
"0" === 0; // False

// Quirk of js
"abc" == new String("abc")       // true
"abc" === new String("abc")      // false
// because ...
typeof "hello world"             // "string"
typeof new String('hello world') // "object"
```

As a general rule always use === and never ==

#### let vs var vs const

If don't use a keyword, variable is declared on Global scope. Aka global variable. Bad!

"var" original way of declaring a variable. Behaves a bit funkily at times

"let" is new way - Prefer over var. Difference is around how they behave within scopes. E.g. a for loop. If you have programmed before "let" behaves the way you are used to. "var" is different

"const" - Constant. Value is not allowed to change \(aka be set again\) \(Prefer this over let when can use\)

```text
let a = 10;
var b = 10;
const c = 10;

// Let variable is not visible outside of the loop
for(let i = 0; i <10; i++){
  // ...
}
console.log(i); // undefined

// But var variable is
for(var j = 0; j <10; i++){
  // ...
}
console.log(j); // 10
```

#### No strong types in javascript

```javascript
var mycar = {
  brand: "Honda",
  model: "Accord",
  year: 1998
};
```

### Functions

```javascript
function myFunc(theObject) {
  theObject.brand = "Toyota";
}

/* Pass object reference to the function */
myFunc(mycar);

// other way to define a function
var myFunction = function() {
  theObject.brand = "BMW";
}

// or with this way. In stack traces when error get a better error message (but no one does this way)
var myFunction = function namedFunction(){
    statements
}

myFunction(mycar);
```

#### Arrow functions

The arrow function expression \(=&gt;\). Very similar to C\#

```javascript
(t) => { console.log(t); }
```

#### Self invoking functions

```javascript
(function() {
    statements
})();
```

The function invokes as soon as the script is loaded. See it alot in jquery

```javascript
$(function () {
  // code to run once all view elements are initialised
})();
```

#### Function hoisting

Scripted but functions get read first so can call them from anywhere in script

#### Q&A

What happens if I pass in more parameters to a function than it has slots?  
What happens if I pass in less?

## Teacher Recommendations

#### What worked well in the past

#### What hasn't worked well in the past



## Class Ex: Fizz buzz



HW Fizz Buzz -Fun drinking game and teaching tool for division for kids.  
 Count from 1 to 100. For each number output "This is X out of 100"  
 Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 3 and 5 become fizz buzz.

Sample output:

> This is 1 out of 100  
>  This is 2 out of 100  
>  Fizz  
>  This is 4 out of 100  
>  Buzz  
>  Fizz  
>  This is 7 out of 100  
>  ...

## Multiple choice questions

```javascript
da === 3
```

What happens here  
a. da is now 3  
b. We are comparing da to 3

```javascript
if(da [?] 3){
    // do something
}
```

What should be in \[?\]  
a. =  
b. ==  
c. ===

I want you to create a snake game in codepen. Those guides can help you out. If you can add some additional cool features \(so I know you didn't just copy and paste!!! :D\)
