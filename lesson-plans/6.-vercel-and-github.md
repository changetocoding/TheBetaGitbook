Surprisingly hard to teach. Think should split so step by step walk through steps of how to create a repositiory on github

1. **Clone** that repository locally
2. **Add** a file to it
3. **Commit** 
4. Set up stream then **push** to it
5. Then update file in vs code
6. **Stage/Commit** the file commit
7. **Push** it
8. Then update file again/add a new file
9. Repeat same in vscode
10. Then repeat using command line.

### Vercel

Was dead easy for students to work out by themselves and get it done  
Just point them at vercel website and get them to add github project they just created online

Important points:

* The root of the project must be named index.html otherwise shows folder structure.
