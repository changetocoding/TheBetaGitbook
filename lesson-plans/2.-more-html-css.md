### Html

_Make sure to explain you must close every Tag_

#### Pre/Br tags

How do you split this address up?

```text
<p> 12 Fox Lane
London
SW1 8DD
</p>
```

#### Line breaks in html

A line break is a seperation of text through the creation of a new line, we can use this to format text such as address lines to create a single text with a text on each new line.

We can accomplish this through the use of three different ways

* Break tag - Seperates the line where the tag is used - has no ending tags.

```markup
<html>
    <title>Welcome to Web Development Lesson 2</title>
    <body>
        <p>This<br>is<br>a<br>Line<br>Break<br>
    </body>
</html>
```

* Pre tag - Keeps the formatting for the text exactly the same including line breaks and spaces.

```markup
<html>
    <title>Welcome to Web Development Lesson 2</title>
    <body>
        <pre>This is the pre tag              ,
             any information displayed in this tag
             preserves spaces and line breaks.
        </pre>
    </body>
</html>
```

```markup
<html>
    <title>Welcome to Web Development Lesson 2</title>
    <body>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line">
          abc
          def
          ghi
        </p> 
    </body>
</html>
```



**A Tag**

A tags let you link to another website, page or even element

```markup
<a href="https://tbhp.gitbook.io/thebeta/">A link to our course notes</a>
```

**More on Divs**

_Go through Div tag. Explain usefulness: It is a general way to group together elements, especially for styling. Briefly explain and tell them we will be using in more depth when we get to css_

What is a div tag? Div is a tag that we use to define a section / division in HTML. Also acts as a container for html elements to be styled in CSS

_Class Ex: Practise &lt;pre&gt; &lt;br&gt; and &lt;a&gt; tags_

### CSS

Allows you to add styles. Styles change the appearance of an element and make it look lovely

Three ways of doing it:

* The style tag allows us to do inline styles in the html
* Can be a linked style sheet
* Can use the style attribute on an element

#### Example of styling using style tag:

```markup
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

The style tag **must** be placed within the head tag

#### Style attribute

_Explain what an attribute is_

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

_Display same with style attribute_ _Get students to do it and save as a new file_

```markup
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>

<div style="background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
</div>

<div style="background-color: tomato;
  color: white;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;">
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

#### CSS in a separate file

_Display same with CSS in seperate file and linked on html page. Get students to do it and save as a new file_

```markup
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/index.css" type="text/css">
</head>
```

### CSS Selectors

How to target element to be styled:

* By tag
* By element id
* By class

_Inform we have been using class and demonstrate by tag \(e.g. the h2 tag\)_

_See Jacob slide deck for full description of CSS selectors_

{% page-ref page="2.-more-html-css.md" %}

#### The box model

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

#### The power of Divs

Last lesson went through divs. But didn't explain why so useful. Styling is one of the places as you can group together elements to be styled in a certain way

```markup
<html>
<head>
<style>
.text-white{
  color: white;
}
.city-a {
  background-color: tomato;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
.city-b {
  background-color: black;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="text-white">
  <div class="city-a">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="city-b">
    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="city-a">
    <h2>Tokyo</h2>
    <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
  </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example we've styled all the text white, but styled the three blocks differently using divs

#### Closing to students

You can get CSS help from here: [Css-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)

Html page  
\|-&gt; Css files  
\|-&gt; Js scripts

## Teacher Recommendations:

* Live server in vs code to live reload code
* Have a split screen setup so don't have to switch screens as often.
* Pre-prepare the html files for the exs for the students so can just jump right in and for example add the style attribute to an element.
* DO NOT cover tables: won't be useful in next few days
